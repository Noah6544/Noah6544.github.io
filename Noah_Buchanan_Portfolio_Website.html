	<body>### A high schooler from metro Atlanta wanting to major in CS and do big things.
#### I *love* programming becase you can take an idea, and turn it into reality.  
#### I’m currently working on:
- (Passion Project): A daily picture aligner automation tool, which would take a large directory of images and align the image to eye coordinates. This is in hopes to automate the many hours of editing and dedication needed to a long project.

- [SpaceShip Game!](https://github.com/Noah6544/Pygame_Spaceship_Game)

#### Projects I've contributed to:
- Project "Inspire Technology":
    - I finished teaching a class of 4-5th graders over the span of 5 weeks how to code in python and how to build computers! The data I gathered from before/after survers were very positive and I see that a few students went above and beyond and took their learning outside of our class. Many of the students noted that they are more interested in coding and building computers, and may pursue it in the future. I'm planning on building a educational website targeted for this age group with the goal to demystify technology (coding, building computers, helping them understand computer components).
