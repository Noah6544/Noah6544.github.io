            Hey, I'm Noah Buchanan; I'm a senior attending Rockdale Magnet, and I'm aspiring to attend Georgia Tech!
            <br><br>
            For as long as I can remember, I've had random hobbies that I couldn't help but pour myself into. From yo-yos, to card tricks, to video editing and vfx: whenever I'm interested in something, I can't help but spend all my time on it. 
            <br><br>
            As I've "grown" some interests left, but I've noticed some stick around longer than others. Aside from my faith in Christ, which I hope is my #1 priority, right now it's all about <u>coding,</u> <u>guitar,</u> and <u>running</u>. 
            <br><br>
            I only recenty learned why I have get so consumed by my passions after realizing all my efforts in learning were just attempts to try to satisfy an insatiable curiosity I have for understanding. The result every project I take on is just a bonus to the understanding I gained.
            <br><br>
            You can check out how well this is going on my projects page, you can check out some of my work on my resume, right <a href="../assets/NoahBuchananResume.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>

                April 4, 2023. After a tough track workout that left me feeling like I had nothing left,

                I thought, <i>'I'm capable of so much more aren't I'</i>
