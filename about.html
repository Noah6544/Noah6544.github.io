            Hey, I'm Noah Buchanan; I'm a senior attending Rockdale Magnet, and I'm aspiring to attend Georgia Tech!
            <br><br>
            For as long as I can remember, I've had random hobbies that I couldn't help but pour myself into. From yo-yos, to card tricks, to video editing and vfx: whenever I'm interested in something, I can't help but spend all my time on it. 
            <br><br>
            As I've "grown" some interests left, but I've noticed some stick around longer than others. Aside from my faith in Christ, which I hope is my #1 priority, right now it's all about <u>coding,</u> <u>guitar,</u> and <u>running</u>. 
            <br><br>
            I only recently learned why I get so consumed by my passions. I realized all my efforts to learn are just attempts to try to satisfy an insatiable curiosity I have for understanding. The result of every project I take on is just a bonus to the understanding I gained.
            <br><br>
            Other than that, please feel free to reach out if you want to talk or if you have any questions! You can find my email on the contact page!
            <br><br>
