                    <div class="project-description" id="project-django"> I built an educational webcourse using Django for my science fair project! The project went to the state fair!

                    <div class="project-extended-description" id="project-DJANGO">
                        For my final research project at magnet, I naively decided to build an educational webapp 
                        using Django, a web-framework that I- within context of what I know now -knew truly nothing about (aside from it being professional). 
                        I wanted to demystify coding for kids, teaching python in the way I would've taught my younger self. Even if the user didn't retain any information about programming,
                        if they learn that it is simpler than it was, I would be satisfied. In other words, I wanted to "Bridge The Gap," hence the name.
                        <br>At the time I didn't even know what a web-framework really was, let alone the beast that was Django.
                        However, if I really wanted to learn Django (something I wanted to tackle the summer prior), I would have to put something on the line to make sure I accomplished it, which was my class grade.
                        <br>So I got to work. I started with the Django poll-app tutorial. After hours of coding on bus rides, car rides, late nights, early mornings, things working, COUNTLESS things breaking 
                        and being troublesome, and creating 3,000+ words of course content, I finished the website and looked up with weary proud eyes that I learned Django, and better yet, I understood what I was doing.
                        <br>While I had 0 time left to learn ANYTHING about making the website look good, it worked, all 30+ pages of spontaneously rendered content.
                        I went to the Georgia State Science Fair with this project, where I received 5th place honors. 
                        But the real accomplishment for me was definitely learning a professional web-framework which I hope will serve me well. If not, I am much more confident in my learning abilities!

                    <div class="project-description" id="project-IT">
                        Starting in my 10th grade year, I've worked with CJ Hicks, and Davis Middle School to teach classes about computers and coding!
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-extended-description" id="project-IT">
                        In the second semester of my 10th grade year, my mom had a great idea. Given my experience teaching myself about building computers, and coding,
                        she thought I might be able to pour into the future generation (I say that like I'm far removed from students who are only a few years younger than me) by teaching
                        them about technology, something I personally felt was lacking in my pre-high-school education.
                        <br>After getting in touch with CJ Hicks elementary, I was very graciously granted a 30 minute slot after their school ended to teach about technology!
                        Due to limitations in my schedule, I only was able to meet with the students about 6 times until the year ended, but I knew I helped light a spark for coding in some of the students.
                        They would come in and show me what they coded, and others would be smiling ear to ear when I taught. I felt honored to be given so much freedom to teach ANYTHING (seriously, no one was looking over my shoulder for the presentations) I wanted!
                        I even surveyed students before/after to see their growth/feedback they had, and I sent the feedback to the superintendent and a few important people who helped make this a reality, but they never responded lol. 
                        <br> You can check out the anonymous feedback <a href="../assets/Event Feedback Survey CJ Hicks; Noah Buchanan.xlsx">here (excel file).</a>
                        <br>Due to lack of flexibility in my schedule, I wasn't able to continue this in my 11th grade year. However, through my privilege of driving, every other Friday I'm teaching at Davis Middle!
                        I'm very excited about this because I will have <i>all year</i> with these students, as opposed to a few sessions. Also, these students are more mature and can grasp the concepts more easily (I hope...). 
                        I'm only a few weeks into working with these students and it's been an absolute joy so far, I really cannot believe I'm going to be able to work with them all year. I can't wait to see what we accomplish.
                        <br> I'd like to thank Mrs. Baskett, Mr. Cook, Dr. Wakefall, Ms. Price, Ms. Chambers, and Mr. Dyer for all giving their help in allowing me to teach in many different ways.

                        This also isn't my best work, so I don't want to waste time going into too much detail. Although I would like to mention the biggest bragging point for this project was likely dealing with big data.

                        This is the longest passion project I've ever managed to not give up on- completely anyways.
                        <br> When I started this project, I barely knew how to open files in python let alone work with OpenCV and Mediapipe.
                        However, through my facial recognition research project, I gained skills along the way that helped me in this project.
                        <br> From the gif that you can see, you can tell that this project is working, and I'm very proud of it, it's a long time coming. However, there are still many details to iron out, 
                        and more optimizations to be made for this project, such as automating the rotation and scale of images, creating an easy to use script for people, or perhaps even a GUI.

                    My portfolio website built from scratch with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS! 
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-extended-description" id="project-Portfolio">
                    I started messing around with HTML, CSS and JS about a year ago after working on my Django site. 
                    I spent maybe a few weeks learning CSS and immediately felt super cool, so I quickly hosted a website I was working onto github pages- it was really bad.
                    <br>But, going into the summer, I was motivated by my good friend Roderick Sneed to make some moves and continue to learn more about a weakness of mine: front-end. 
                    The plan was for me to learn ReactJS, and javascript- 2 things which I knew little about. I started this website in April, working on and off for a few months. 
                    <br>I never planned for the website to look like this, every feature I've added has just slowly evolved the website more and more until it took on a shape of its own that just seemed to fit.
                        <br>I'm most proud of:
                        <br>(1), making this website, in my naive opinion, quite complex. I didn't have much of a guide to learn about the proper HTML, CSS, or JS 
                        structures, so I really am just learning as I go along, and it seemed to have turned out alright.
                        <br>(2) The scroll effect. I didn't have a tutorial, but I had perseverance and A LOT of patience with myself (seriously, this effect was super buggy at the start, nearly gave up).
                        The only assistance I had was AI to help me come up with a way to slowly increase a value such that my images would slowly speed up and slow down on hover! I thought this effect was clean and very fun to interact with as a user. 
                        <br>(3) The project card effect. I once again didn't have a tutorial for this effect, I had an idea and with it a vague notion as to what the structure of the effect would need to be, so I got to work. 
                        This project card effect was the first lengthy effect I created on this page. It had a ton of bugs so I'm not even going to mess with the nasty CSS I created.
                        <br> Please let me know what you think of this website, what some improvements could be, or just what you like about it!
                        <br> Finally, I would like to thank my friends who gave me feedback when I asked for it, I would like to give a special thanks to Prakash who inspired a lot and held me to a higher standard and was b
                        brutally honest, and to Roderick Sneed, who is kind of the reason I decided to revamp this website in the first place given our great conversation on the bus ride home that one day.
                        I would also like to thank Mr. Jesse Smith who taught us Java in my AP CS class. It made transitioning to JS pretty simple, as JS and Java are syntactically very similiar- who knew.
                        <br> P.S. this website was inspired by many portfolio websites, but none more than <a href="https://oliverqiu.cool" target="_blank">Oliver Qiu's,</a> it's kind of concerning how many interests we share (guitar, coding, and music artists)...                </div>

                <div class="project-extended-description" id="project">
                    My older sister got a guitar for Christmas many years back, but she never truly played it. Like many other guitars, it sat collecting dust.
                    I tried to learn the guitar in the summer of 2018, but I didn't take the right approach. I was just trying to play 'a hundred chords a day,' and I wasn't making music, so I put it down after about 2 months.
                    <br>Then the pandemic happened.
                    <br> You can see where this is going. I picked up the guitar again, this time with determination, or rather, a sort of desperation to have something to distract myself. I'd always been so impressed with the guys who knew guitar,
                    how they effortlessly played cool songs and made their own riffs. 'This will never be me, I will never be this good,' were some of my initial thoughts.
                    <br>I started with <a href="https://www.justinguitar.com/" target="_blank">Justin Guitar</a> as I heard good things from the course (Justin is seriously the #1 reason I play guitar today, check him and his music theory course out if you're interested in guitar!).
                    <br>I look up and a few years have gone by and I am intrigued by the mystery of music theory and I love all things guitar. I'm playing with my church's worship team, I'm working on some songs and trying to learn some advanced fingerstyle pieces.
                    <br>I could go on an on about how this instrument has changed me by opening up new relationships and giving me opportunities, but I would first like to thank Mr. Danny, who graciously gave me his red, 1998 electric guitar shortly before he passed away. Without him, I would be much less of the guitar player that I am today (seriously, I wouldn't have been able to mess around with distortion, working with DAWs, or many other techniques limited to electric guitar).
                    <br>Secondly, I HAVE to thank my great friend, Jairus Butler who graciously gifted me his amazing Fender champion 20 amp, without Jairus I wouldn't be able to even use my guitar! I'm so blessed to have good friends who look out for me.
                    <br>There's really too much I can talk about, so I'll digress by saying I'll be playing this instrument, learning its secrets and intricacies for the rest of my life, forming lifelong relationships along the way. 
                    <br>You can check out the hardest song I've learned to play so far, right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a2ysrOUMKc" target="_blank">here.</a> Plus, I'll be trying to upload some more guitar related stuff to that channel soon.

                    I've been raised in a Christian family, but I wouldn't say it was until the summer of 2022 where I really took this faith on as my own.
                    <br>I've become very interested in apologetics and the more I think about my beliefs, the more I realize the importance of intellectual consistency.
                    <br>I grew tired (and I still grow tired everyday) of not fully devoting myself and just labeling myself as Christian, while still being indistinguishable from anyone else.
                    <br>There's not much else to say, I believe that no amount of good deeds I do could atone for my great sin, I believe in the resurrection of Christ and that through it I am justified. 
                    If I truly am convinced of this I should be yelling from the rooftops of eternal life, which I of course don't. I will always fall immeasurably short of the standard I want to hold myself to, but I encourage you to weigh the evidence yourself and follow it where it goes.
                    <br>I believe that the case for Christianity is quite reasonable. I wrote a 16 page research paper last year "Investigating the Legitimacy of Christianity," if you're interested, please check it out <a href="../assets/Investigating The Legitimacy of Christianity Noah Buchanan.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> 
                    (I honestly think paper is pretty weak, but the sources are much more valuable).

                </div>
                <div class="project-description" id="project-running">I love this sport, I want to see what my true potential is- if I have any. There's no luck or any flash in this sport, just results from dull, consistent hard work.<div>  
                <div class="project-extended-description" id="project-running">My running journey started as my soccer story. I'd played soccer all my life, and I was pretty good at it too. However, due to many reasons, my love for that sport drifted. 
                    Essentially, I began to look forward to the running part of soccer more than the part when I had the ball. 
                    <br> I ran track in middle school, for the 1600, I ran 6:04 in 7th grade, and I only was able to run 6:02 in 8th grade before the pandemic hit.
                    <br>I dreamt about running cross country in high school, watching YouTube videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69mT5ig3dsg" target="_blank">these</a> really excited me.
                    <br>I stopped running for awhile due to an 'injury' and then due to a semi-real injury. Looking back however, I was more lazy than hurt. Due to this and the pandemic, I had no freshman year running experience, and I was very out of shape and slightly overweight going into the summer training period before my sophmore year. But I got to work.
                    <br>Sophomore Year: first XC race I ran 26:34. That season I PRed with a 22:45. I actually got hurt again (due to growth I assume) and didn't run track. I stopped running for 6 months.
                    <br>Junior Year: after 6 months of no running, I started training in the summer. My first race I managed to PR and make it back to where I was the season prior with a 22:39. I kept training, mile after mile, week in and week out. 
                    At the regional race in October, I finally managed to <del>break</del> shatter the 20 minute barrier as I ran 19:15, the race before was 21:16. 
                    This year I decided to run AAU track, and I soon learned that track workouts are a different beast. I managed to run a 4:27 1500m, and my most proud achievement was winning the AAU Regional 3k race in a 9:50, which is two 4:55 1500m's stringed back to back...which was my early season time trial.
                    <br>Senior Year: I'm running more miles than I ever had, pushing 40 mile weeks (honestly my first year being a semi-decent runner unfortunately, I wish I had more time...but no excuses) and lots of hard sessions.
                     My goal is to go sub 17 in the 5k, <a href="https://youtu.be/Yw0YFvoU2TQ?t=97" target="_blank">a foolish dream</a> but I wouldn't be waking up at 5:20am for double runs if I was working toward a realistic dream.
                    <br>You can find my Strava <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/noahbuchanan" target="_blank">here,</a> but I don't currently post all my runs like I used to, only my races. Rest assured that I'm running everyday though, I haven't given up on my dream yet.
