                        due to Covid, I experimented with cutting my hair and I haven't been to a
                        barber since. I occasionally cut my friends hair and I'm the permanent barber for my 2 younger brothers and sometimes my older brother when he comes home from Georgia Tech.

                        <div class="neucha">Although my interest has been slowly replaced with coding, 3D modeling and making 'art' was something I was passionate about for a good time.
                        Check out these renders of my Tech Fair project 2 years ago. I worked with Gabriel Barnes.

                        <div class="neucha">When I was 10, like everyone else my age, I made a YouTube channel and posted a lot of random stuff. It started with gaming but slowly turned into a VFX channel with short films.
                            I was involved in the Film program in middle school and made a few short films for competitions during my time there.   
                        This all ultimately led me into being more interested in computers. <br>

                        <div class="neucha">I built my 'gaming' PC in 2018 and continued to upgrade it through 2022. The friend I played rocket league with was Gabriel Barnes (and pretty much every other game too).
                        We shared a lot of laughs and lot of pain in this game. I have 100+ gb of clips, here's a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKcABqFJuqd5SvBUQDF6DURSzV22hrRFO&si=7gEeB_eI8KBoJs-W" target="_blank">playlist</a> I'm updating with some notable clips.</div></li>
